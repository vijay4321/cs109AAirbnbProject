Great job! I am having a bit of a hard time understanding what you mean by the first_review, last_review. Perhaps setting this all to be the most recent last review may be more helpful. Or you can take the average of all existing reviews to fill in missing values as well. Wow! Great idea adding the season! It is a good way to aggregate date data without adding too many categorical predictors. I really like your visualization on the seasons. As you have mentioned, it doesn't seem to suggest that seasonal effects have much of an impact for specific holidays may have spikes. It may also help to look at the response variable distribution to see if it is right skewed. You want to check your assumptions before you use models such as linear regression, which operate under the assumption of normally distributed response variables. Great job and looking forward to your final project!
