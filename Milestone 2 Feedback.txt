Great job on the literature review! I know that the first literature went into image data but that does not necessarily have to be in the scope of the project and is likely going to take longer than what this project will expect. Very well organized summaries. Hopefully the readings gave some more insight on how to utilize a lot of different data to predict housing and reviews. Just to clarify, you plan on projecting the Airbnb prices in multiple buckets? Perhaps a high, mid, low? This would be a very useful application to help both home owners and renters understand the value of the property. For next steps, think about data visualizations you want to look at and how you may approach this on a technical sense. Doing data visualizations with histograms, scatterplots, and looking for missing data to impute these will also be very helpful in the next step! Great job and looking forward to the rest of the project.
